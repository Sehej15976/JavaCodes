//program to add two fractions 
// Example 1:
// Input: 3/4 + 1/7 
// Output: 25/28
// Explanation: Since 3/4 + 1/7 = 25/28

// The denominator will be lcm of den1 and den2.Then change the num1 and num2 as we changed den1 and den2 to lcm and then add the new num1 and num2 to get the new numerator.

//1. First find gcd of den1 and den2 using euclideanâ€™s algorithm.Once we get the gcd we can easily find lcm.lcm(den1,den2) is (den1*den2)/gcd(den1,den2).
//2.  Now we will have to change num1 and num2 to num1*(den3/den1) and num2*(den3/den2),since we changed den1 and den2 to lcm.
//3.  Now add num1 and num2 and store it in the num3.

//4.  Now we have num3 and den3.The answer should be num3/den3,but before printing the answer we should convert it into the simplest form.
//5.  To convert it into the simplest form,divide numerator and denominator both by gcd of numerator and denominator.
// Print num3 / den3.
