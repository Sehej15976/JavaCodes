// Input: arr = [2, 4, 1, 7, 5, 0]
// Output: [2, 4, 5, 0, 1, 7]
// Explanation: The next permutation of the given array is 2 4 5 0 1 7

//The very basic idea that comes to our mind is that we would first generate all possible permutations of a given array and sort them. Once sorted, we locate the current permutation within this list.
